    <div class='p ver'>Version 2.1.0</div>
    <div class='p date'>Nov 7 2022</div>
    <div class='p chng'>Overview</div>
    <div class='p note'>
      This patch fixes a few bugs from 2.0.0 and adds various new content to the game.<br>
    </div>
    <div class='p chng'>Map Hazards</div>
    <div class='p note'>
      A new feature of this update is map objects.<br>
      These are objects that are specific to each map and have various gameplay effects.
      This includes things like teleporters, jump pads, bumpers, and voids.<br>
      Many of the original maps have been updated to include some of these new map hazards.<br>
    </div>
    <div class='p chng'>Sports Ball</div>
    <div class='p note'>
      A brand new game type! Based off a game mode from Nox called Noxball.<br>
      It's basically football/soccer. Grab the ball, and shoot it into the enemy teams goal to score points.<br>
      The default key to shoot the ball is 's'<br>
      The ball has special physics and is pretty easy to handle. It's very bouncy so try banking it off walls to score goals from unexpected angles!
      Passing the ball to a teammate also provides a short boost to shooting power. So remember! Teamwork!<br>
    </div>
    <div class='p chng'>New Maps</div>
    <div class='p note'>
      1 new map for normal game modes.<br>
      3 new maps specifically designed for Sports Ball.<br>

    <div class='p note'>
      Multi-kill timer has been extended slightly.<br>

    <div class='p note'>
      Old character!<br>
      Has been in the game as a non-functional test character for a long time.<br>
      I gave him some meme abilities and made him cost 100k points.<br>
      He is a joke character and nearly impossible to play.<br>
    </div>
    <div class='p chng'>Mod Support</div>
    <div class='p note'>
      The games map editor is now accessible from the settings menu.<br>
      Users who have purchased the game may upload a custom map for their account.<br>
      Restricted to 1 map per account. Uploading a new maps will overwrite your old one.<br>
      Custom maps can be played by creating a custom game with the 'Advanced' option.<br>
      Custom maps have their authors name written next to them. Official maps have the author 'InfernoPlus'.<br>
      If a map is good I may put it on the official map rotation.<br>
    </div>
    <div class='p chng'>Custom Games</div>
    <div class='p note'>
      You can now create custom games that are private.<br>

      The 'advanced' option allows you to setup a map rotation and have it set to in order or random selection.<br>

    <div class='p note'>
