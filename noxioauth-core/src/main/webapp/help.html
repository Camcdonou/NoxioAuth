        The game controls can be adjusted at any time by hitting escape and then selecting &#39;settings&#39; and then &#39;controls&#39;.<br>
        By default the controls are: <br>
        &#9899; Escape - Open Menu<br>
        &#9899; Right Click - Move character<br>
        &#9899; Space - Jump<br>
        &#9899; F - Ability #1<br>
        &#9899; D - Ability #2<br>
        &#9899; S - Toss Flag<br>
        &#9899; Q - Show Scoreboard<br>
        &#9899; T - Taunt<br>
        &#9899; Middle Click - Rotate Camera<br>
        &#9899; Scroll Wheel - Zoom<br>
        &#9899; Scroll Lock - Toggle UI<br>
        While in spectator mode middle click will instead pan the camera.

      <div class='txt'>
        You can earn credits by playing matches. Your current credit total is displayed in the top right of the screen.<br>
        Once you have earned a substantial number of credits you can return to the main menu and select the &#39;unlocks&#39; option.<br>
        You can then use your credits to unlock characters, alternate character skins, or special game features.<br>

      <div id='lagcomp' class='anc'></div>
      <div class='hed'>Lag Compensation Modes</div>
      <div class='txt'>
        The lag compensation setting in the game settings adjusts the size of the tick buffer for the game.<br>
        This setting is a tradeoff between smooth framerate and input responsiveness. The default is normal.<br>
        There are 4 modes:<br>
        &#9899; Immediate - No buffer. Can potentially make the game more responsive, but only if your connection to the game server is very good.<br>
        &#9899; Normal - 1 tick buffer. This is recommended for most players.<br>
        &#9899; Aggressive - 2 tick buffer. Use this if the game feels somewhat choppy.<br>
        &#9899; Very Aggressive - 3 tick buffer. Use this if the game is very choppy.<br>
      </div>
      
      <div id='framerate' class='anc'></div>
      <div class='hed'>Bad Framerates</div>
      <div class='txt'>
        If the framerate for the game is excessively bad, make absolutely sure that you have hardware acceleration turned on for your browser.<br>
        If hardware acceleration is off the game will likely run at 1 or 2 fps. In chrome you can find that setting at:  &#39;chrome://settings/?search=hardware&#39;<br>
        <br>
        If the game still seems to be running poorly you may need to adjust the graphics settings in the game menu under &#39;settings&#39; and then &#39;graphics&#39;.<br>
        Disabling bloom will usually improve performance drastically. You can also turn off shadows completely and lower the game render quality as well.<br>
        If the games framerate is still consistently below 30, you can also try turning off the chat window in the game settings on the main menu.<br>
        It also might be worth adjusting the &#39;Lag Compensation Mode&#39; setting as well. If your connection to the server is bad it will cause the game to run choppily.<br>
        <br>
        If none of this works it might be worth trying a different browser. Not all browsers implement the WebGL api the same way, and some handle it better than others.<br>

      <div id='customsound' class='anc'></div>
      <div class='hed'>Custom Sounds</div>
      <div class='txt'>
        For users who have bought the game, there is an option in the game settings to upload a custom win sound.<br>
        This sound will play if you come in 1st place at the end of a game.<br>
        The sound file must be a standard .wav audio file under 1mb.<br>
        <b>Misuse of this feature will result in account suspension.</b> Be smart and follow the <span class="lnk" onclick="window.open('./rules.html')">Rules.</span><br><br>
        There is also an option in the game settings menu to disable all custom sounds globally if you want.<br>
      </div>
      
      <div id='loading' class='anc'></div>
      <div class='hed'>Loading Screen Freeze</div>
      <div class='txt'>
        If the game gets stuck on the loading screen it's likely because one or more files failed to download.<br>
        This can sometimes be caused by browser extensions like Adblock Plus. Try disabling extensions if you repeatedly get stuck on the loading screen.<br><br>
        Additionally, some web browsers may not fully support the various apis that are used by the game. If you are having trouble getting the game to load, try using a different browser like Firefox or Chrome.<br>
      </div>
      
      <div id='errorsa' class='anc'></div>
      <div class='hed'>WebGL & WebAudio Errors</div>
      <div class='txt'>
        Make sure that your browser is up to date, and fully supports HTML5, WebGL, and WebAudio extensions.<br>
        In some browsers you may have to enable them manually in the settings. You may also have to manually enable hardware acceleration.<br>
        If hardware acceleration is off the game will likely run at 1 or 2 fps. In chrome you can find that setting at:  &#39;chrome://settings/?search=hardware&#39;<br>

        If you encounter an error message that crashes/closes the game feel free to copy the info and email it to support@20xx.io<br>

      <div class='txt'>
        20XX does partially support mobile web browsers. I cannot guarantee every make and model of phone will work but most standard android phones running google chrome should be fine.<br>
        If the game&#39;s framerate is choppy you can lower the settings in the game menu under &#39;settings&#39; and then &#39;graphics&#39;.<br>
        Some phones have a hard time rendering bloom lighting so try turning that off first.<br><br>
        If the game will not run on your phone:<br>
        &#9899; Try using a standard browser like firefox or chrome<br>
        &#9899; Make sure that WebGL is enabled<br>
        &#9899; Make sure that fullscreen mode is not disabled<br>
        &#9899; Make sure your phone is capable of 3D accelerated graphics<br>
