        The game controls can be adjusted at any time by hitting escape and then selecting &#39;settings&#39; and then &#39;controls&#39;.<br>
        By default the controls are: <br>
        &#9899; Escape - Open Menu
        &#9899; Right Click - Move character<br>
        &#9899; Space - Jump<br>
        &#9899; F - Ability #1<br>
        &#9899; D - Ability #2<br>
        &#9899; S - Toss Flag<br>
        &#9899; Q - Show Scoreboard<br>

      <div class='txt'>
        You can earn credits by playing matches. Your current credit total is displayed in the top right of the screen.<br>
        Once you have earned a substantial number of credits you can then go back to the games menu and select the &#39;unlocks&#39; option.<br>
        You can then use your credits to unlock characters, alternate character skins, or special game features.<br>

      <div class='hed'>Lag Compensation Modes</div>
      <div class='txt'>
        The lag compensation setting in the game settings adjusts the size of the frame buffer for the game.<br>
        There are 4 modes:<br>
        &#9899; Immediate - No buffer. Can potentially make the game more responsive, but only if your connection to the game server is very good.<br>
        &#9899; Normal - 1 frame buffer. This is recommended for most players.<br>
        &#9899; Aggressive - 2 frame buffer. Use this if the game feels somewhat choppy.<br>
        &#9899; Very Aggressive - 3 frame buffer. Use this if the game is very choppy.<br>

      <div id='customsound' class='anc'></div>
      <div class='hed'>Custom Sounds</div>
      <div class='txt'>
        For users who have bought the game, there is an option in the game settings to upload a custom win sound.<br>
        This sound will play if you come in 1st place at the end of a game.<br>
        The sound file must be a standard .wav audio file under 1mb.<br>
        <b>Misuse of this feature will result in account suspension.</b> Be smart and follow the <span class="lnk" onclick="window.open('./rules.html')">Rules.</span><br><br>
        There is also an option in the game settings menu to disable all custom sounds globally if you want.<br>

        Make sure that your browser is up to date, and fully supports HTML5, WebGL, and WebAudio extensions.<br>
        In some browsers you may have to enable them manually in the settings. You may also have to manually enable hardware acceleration.<br>

        If the game appears to be running poorly you may need to adjust the graphics settings in the game menu under &#39;settings&#39; and then &#39;graphics&#39;.<br>
        If that does work, then make sure that hardware acceleration is enabled in your browsers settings.<br>

      <div id='mobile' class='anc'></div>
      <div class='hed'>Mobile Support</div>
      <div class='txt'>
        20XX does partially support mobile web browsers. I cannot guarantee every make and model of phone will work but most standard android phones running google chrome should be fine.<br>
        If the game&#39;s framerate is choppy you can lower the settings in the game menu under &#39;settings&#39; and then &#39;graphics&#39;.<br>
        Some phones have a hard time rendering bloom lighting so try turning that off first.<br><br>
        If the game will not run on your phone:<br>
        &#9899; Try using a standard browser like firefox or chrome<br>
        &#9899; Make sure that WebGL is enabled<br>
        &#9899; Make sure that fullscreen mode is not disabled<br>
        &#9899; Make sure your phone is capable of 3D accelerated graphics<br>
